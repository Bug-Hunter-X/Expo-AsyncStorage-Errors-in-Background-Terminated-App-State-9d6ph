This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo. The issue is that AsyncStorage doesn't work correctly when the app is running in background or when the app is terminated. This is because AsyncStorage is synchronous but the app is in background, making it behave unpredictably.  The key might not get stored correctly or the values might not get retrieved.
