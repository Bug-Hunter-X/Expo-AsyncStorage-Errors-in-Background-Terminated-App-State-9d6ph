# Expo AsyncStorage Background/Termination Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue with AsyncStorage in Expo applications when the app transitions to the background or is terminated.  AsyncStorage's synchronous operations can clash with background processes, resulting in unreliable data storage and retrieval.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problem.  The `bugSolution.js` offers a more robust approach using alternatives to avoid data inconsistencies.

## Problem

AsyncStorage, while convenient, isn't ideal for scenarios where data persistence is crucial while the app is inactive.  Background processes or termination can interrupt synchronous operations, leading to potential data loss or corruption.

## Solution

For reliable background data handling, consider using alternatives such as SQLite, MMKV, or other persistent storage solutions specifically designed for asynchronous operations.  These methods are better equipped to handle the complexities of background processes and app termination.
